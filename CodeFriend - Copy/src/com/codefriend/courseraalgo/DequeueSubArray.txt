The problem is to find the unique elements in the Dequeue with the given array size
now say we have following elements in the Dequeue
5,3,5,2,3,2
and given the size of subarray be 3
so the subarray we have are
5,3,5 unique elements 2
3,5,2 unique elements 3
5,2,3 unique elements 3
2,3,2 unique elements 2

so the maximum number of unique elements is 3

-To solve this problem we can maintain a set and add elements to the set, since the set will maintain
the unique elements , any element added twice will be counted only once
-once the dequeue reaches it's size of sub-array that is 3 
we will check the size of set and at the same time we will remove the element from head, as we have
to keep moving forward
-while removing element we will also check if the element is further present in the dequeue, if
not then we will remove it from set as we don't want to include that element to calculate size of
unique nunmber of elements in next subarray, if we had to calculate the unique value across the dequeue
we won't be removing it
